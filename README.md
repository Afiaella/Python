# Python


## Background

In this project, I used the concepts I've learned to complete **two** Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.


## PyBank Challenge

In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. I used a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". 

I created a Python script that analyzed the records to calculated each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


## PyPoll Instructions

In this challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

I was given a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". I created a Python script that analyzed the votes and calculated each of the following:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote.
